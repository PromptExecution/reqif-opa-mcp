## Codebase Patterns
- Ralph workflow: read prd.json → pick highest priority incomplete story → implement → commit → update PRD → append to progress.txt
- Use Python for Ralph automation scripts (issue fetching, prd conversion, archival)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) used for issue management and PR creation
- Conventional commits format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>` where scope is user story ID
- Archive completed PRDs to ralph/.archive/ with timestamp before starting new work
- Progress learnings should consolidate reusable patterns at the top
- Ralph instructions stored in CLAUDE.md for Claude Code to read

## 2026-01-31 16:36 - US-001
- Implemented archive_prd.py script for archiving completed prd.json files
- Files changed: ralph/archive_prd.py (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Archive script validates all user stories have `passes: true` before archiving
  - Filename format: `prd-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-project-name.json` (kebab-cased)
  - .archive/ directory already exists and is in .gitignore
  - Used returns module pattern for error handling (will be consistent across Ralph scripts)
  - Type hints with mypy --strict passes, ruff linting passes
  - Script is executable standalone: `python3 ralph/archive_prd.py`

## 2026-01-31 17:34 - US-003
- Implemented fetch_github_issue.py script for fetching open GitHub issues
- Files changed: ralph/fetch_github_issue.py (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - gh CLI version 2.31.0 doesn't support --order/--sort flags
  - Workaround: fetch more issues (limit 100) and sort in Python by createdAt
  - Script checks for gh CLI installation and authentication before proceeding
  - Exit codes: 0 for success/no issues, 1 for errors
  - Clear error messages guide users to install gh or run `gh auth login`
  - Type hints with mypy --strict passes, ruff linting passes
  - Script outputs issue JSON to stdout for downstream processing
