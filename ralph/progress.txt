## Codebase Patterns
- This is a greenfield project - no implementation code exists yet
- Use ruff for linting (never black)
- Use PEP 484 type hints for all Python code
- Use uv/uvx for package management (never pip or poetry)
- Use fastmcp >= 0.4.0 for MCP server
- Use "returns" module for Rust-style Result/Option patterns
- JSON schemas follow JSON Schema 2020-12 specification
- All schemas include $schema, $id, title, description, type, required, and properties fields

## 2026-01-30 - US-001
- Implemented canonical requirement record JSON schema for reqif-mcp/1
- Files changed:
  - Created schemas/requirement-record.schema.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Schema directory established at `schemas/` for all data contract schemas
  - Requirement record schema defines the core data model that all other components depend on
  - Schema includes all required fields: uid, key, subtypes[], status enum, policy_baseline object, rubrics[], text, attrs (flexible)
  - Status enum strictly limited to: active, obsolete, draft
  - Policy baseline requires id, version, and hash for traceability
  - Rubrics require engine, bundle, package, rule fields for OPA evaluation
  - Attrs object is flexible with additionalProperties:true to allow domain-specific extensions
